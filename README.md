# Curl Command Converter

With the latest Chrome update, when it comes to resending a specific request in the developer console, the go-to option is often 'Copy As curl (cmd).' However, even if you choose this option, Chrome doesn't provide you with a command that you can use directly, which can be quite frustrating.

I've written a short C++ code that simplifies the conversion of the curl command generated by Chrome into a single line, eliminating a bunch of unnecessary characters. This makes the exported command directly usable and runnable, greatly enhancing ease of use.
